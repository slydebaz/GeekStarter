Node
A node is a Java process running Elasticsearch. Typically each node will run on its own dedicated machine.

Cluster
A cluster is one or more nodes with the same cluster name.

Shard
A shard is a Lucene index. Every index can have one or more shards. Shards can be either the primary shard or a replica.

Index
An index is the rough equivalent of database in relational database land. The index is the top-most level that can be found at http://yourdomain.com:9200/<your index>

Types
Types are objects that are contained within indexes. Think of them like tables. Being a child of the index, they can be found at http://yourdomain.com:9200/<your index>/<some type>

Documents
Documents are found within types. These are basically JSON blobs that can be of any structure. Think of them like rows found in a table.
